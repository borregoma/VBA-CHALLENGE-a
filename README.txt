# VBA-CHALLENGE-a

This exercise was extremely hard. Not familiar with syntaxis.

1.- alphabetical_testingV3
This file was used to troubleshoot the scripts. Multiple versions, until TA supported me to keep going. 
2.- Multiple_year_stock_dataV1
I was not able to consolidate all the individual spreadsheet into one. It could be because of the size of the data, but I omitted the 1st part of my script.

Again, ready for the new challenges and would continue to practice VBA for future challenges.
